This is a library for reading magnetic stripes through PCM audio data.

As of version 1.0, it only supports ABA encoding as found on track 2 of
magnetic stripe cards.

Included in this package:
mslib - The library
mstest - a C program to test the library with PCM audio files

mslib and mstest are tersely documented.  The latter should provide a basic
usage example.  Refer to mslib.h for additional documentation.

Requirements:
glib-2.0


To compile mslib and mstest, run "make".
